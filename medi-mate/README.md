# MediMate - Your Personal Medicine Reminder App

**Project Title:** MediMate â€“ A React Native App for Medicine Reminders and Health Tracking  
**Developer:** Riddhi Khera â€“ 2024-B-02042007

## Problem Statement

Many people, especially the elderly and patients with chronic illnesses, often forget to take their medicines on time. Missing doses can lead to serious health consequences. Current reminder apps are often complicated, cluttered, or lack personalization. MediMate aims to solve this problem with a clean, simple, and intuitive mobile app designed for quick medicine scheduling and reliable notifications.

## Proposed Solution

A cross-platform mobile application built using React Native that allows users to set medicine reminders, track their dosage history, and store basic health notes. The app sends timely push notifications and keeps all reminders organized in a minimal and accessible interface.

## Key Features

âœ… **Add, edit, and delete medicine schedules**  
âœ… **Push notifications for medicine reminders**  
âœ… **Simple list view of upcoming doses**  
âœ… **Local storage for offline use**  
âœ… **Profile section for personal and medical notes**  
âœ… **Clean and minimal UI for easy navigation**  

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, React Navigation
- **State Management:** useContext, useReducer, Context API
- **Data Storage:** AsyncStorage (local database)
- **Notifications:** Expo Notifications API
- **Navigation:** React Navigation Bottom Tabs

## Architecture

### Context API Implementation
- **MedicineContext:** Centralized state management using useContext and useReducer
- **State Management:** Reducer pattern for predictable state updates
- **Data Flow:** Unidirectional data flow with context providers

### Key Components
- **MedicineProvider:** Context provider wrapping the entire app
- **useMedicine:** Custom hook for accessing medicine context
- **Reducer Pattern:** useReducer for complex state management

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd medi-mate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

- **Screen Navigation:** Seamless navigation between screens
- **Tab Icons:** Ionicons for visual navigation

### 5. Notifications
- **Push Notifications:** Timely reminders using Expo Notifications
- **Permission Handling:** Automatic permission requests
- **Scheduling:** Daily recurring notifications

## Usage Guide

### Adding a Medicine
1. Navigate to the "Add Medicine" tab

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Context API Usage
```javascript
// MedicineContext.js
const MedicineContext = createContext();
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(medicineReducer, initialState);

// Usage in components
const { medicines, addMedicine, deleteMedicine } = useMedicine();
```

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
// Reducer for predictable state updates
const medicineReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_MEDICINE':
      return { ...state, medicines: [...state.medicines, action.payload] };
    // ... other cases
  }
};
```

### Data Storage Integration
```javascript
// AsyncStorage with Context
const addMedicine = async (medicineData) => {
  const newMedicine = { id: Date.now().toString(), ...medicineData };
  await AsyncStorage.setItem('@medimates_medicines', JSON.stringify(updatedMedicines));
  dispatch({ type: 'ADD_MEDICINE', payload: newMedicine });
};
```

## Future Enhancements

This is an MVP that can be expanded with:
- Cloud sync for multi-device access
- Multi-user support for families
- Health report tracking and analytics
- Integration with healthcare providers
- Medication interaction warnings
- Photo capture for medicine identification
